# Public Machine Learning Datasets

A lot of people might already know about these but here is a list of well known publicly available datasets you can use to play around with, from various sources.

I hope this helps you get started with your Machine Learning journey.

# [Registry of Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/)
Amazon provides 101 different types of datasets, raging from terrain tiles, Bird occurences to space imagery.

# [UCI Machine Learning Dataset Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html)
Almost 500 different datasets in many different domains (medicine, physics, finance)

# [Google Dataset Search Tool](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch)
This is Google for Dataset search. No jokes. Literally.

# [Microsoft Research Open Data](https://msropendata.com/)
Of course Microsoft also has their own repository of datasets. They are broken down by domain:

Biology, Physics, Social, Sciences, Information Science, Computer Science, Engineering, Healthcare, Environmental Science, Earth Science and Mathematics.
